# Research Project â€“ Comparative Study of SHAP and LIME in Explainable AI for Diabetes Risk Prediction

1) Conducted a research-based project using Explainable AI (XAI) to compare SHAP and LIME in predicting diabetes risk, with a focus on Body Mass Index (BMI) relevance.

2) Implemented and visualized SHAP and LIME algorithms in Python to evaluate feature importance, interpretability, and computational performance.

3) Analyzed model transparency in healthcare predictions and addressed research gaps by investigating BMI as a dominant factor using real-world healthcare data and explainable AI visualizations.
